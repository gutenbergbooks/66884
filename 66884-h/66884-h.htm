<p class="xd31e135"><span class="xd31e135init">T</span>he story of Joseph is at once so simple that childhood is arrested and rivetted by
it, and so profound that sages may deepen their wisdom by meditating on the truths
which it embodies. An attempt is here made to point out some of the more important
lessons which the narrative teaches,—to manifest the wisdom and the watchfulness of
Providence,—and show how God on high exercises his prerogative of educing good from
what we are often tempted <span class="pageNum" id="pb.vi">[<a href="#pb.vi">vi</a>]</span>to regard as only and hopelessly evil. While man displays his wickedness by committing
sin, the Holy One displays his goodness by restraining it; and though his ways are
confessedly “a great deep,” we get glimpses through the gloom,—we catch echoes amid
the silence, which enable us to know, that when the tangled web of providence shall
have been unrolled in light, it will be seen that he “has done all things well.” As
the bones of Joseph were carried before the Hebrews during all their wanderings, from
Egypt to Canaan, till they found a resting-place in that land of promise, the truth
of God here goes before us still, a very pillar of cloud and of fire.

<p class="xd31e254"><span class="xd31e254init">W</span>hen Jesus would inculcate some of the deepest lessons which he ever taught, he took
a little child and set him in the midst of his disciples (<a class="biblink xd31e40" title="Reference to the Bible: Matthew 18:2-4" href="https://classic.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mt%2018:2-4&amp;version=NRSV">Matt. xviii. 2–4</a>), and made that child his text. Truth thus found an inlet into the mind which even
the Great Teacher might have attempted in vain to impress, without some material illustration
of his spiritual lessons.—Let us <span class="pageNum" id="pb10">[<a href="#pb10">10</a>]</span>endeavour to imitate the Saviour’s wisdom, and seek some lessons to guide us in the
touching history of Joseph.
</p>
<p>It is well known, then, that on a certain occasion that youth obtained permission
to visit his brothers at a part of Canaan somewhat distant from their father’s home.
But, previous to that time, he had given them great offence; and their anger only
waited for a fit occasion to break forth in violence against him. And we should not
fail to notice what caused that anger. First, Joseph was a great favourite with his
father, who testified his partiality to the boy by the gift of a coat of many colours,
and thus unwisely laid a foundation for feuds and divisions in his family (<a class="biblink xd31e40" title="Reference to the Bible: Genesis 37:3-4" href="https://classic.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gn%2037:3-4&amp;version=NRSV">Gen. xxxvii. 3, 4</a>). Moreover, Joseph had dreamed certain dreams which gave great offence to his brothers;
for they indicated that the time would come when the other <span class="pageNum" id="pb11">[<a href="#pb11">11</a>]</span>children of Jacob would do homage to Joseph, who was one of the youngest (<a class="biblink xd31e40" title="Reference to the Bible: Genesis 37:5-11" href="https://classic.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gn%2037:5-11&amp;version=NRSV">Gen. xxxvii. 5–11</a>). The feelings which rankled in the bosoms of his brothers before, now rankled more
and more, and were ripened by irritation for a violent outbreak at last. It appears,
further, that Joseph had, at least on one occasion (ver. 2), complained to his father
regarding the misdeeds of his brothers; and all these things made him “hated by them,
so that they could not speak peaceably to him.”—All this suggests to us the strange
lesson, that there are some men who “hate him that rebuketh them, and abhor him that
speaketh uprightly” (<a class="biblink xd31e40" title="Reference to the Bible: Amos 5:10" href="https://classic.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Am%205:10&amp;version=NRSV">Amos v. 10</a>). Men are so wedded to their own ways, even when they lead down to death, that we
become their enemy if we tell them the truth. How often did scribe, Pharisee, priest,
and people break out in <span class="pageNum" id="pb12">[<a href="#pb12">12</a>]</span>violence against Jesus for his truthful warnings!
</p>
<p>No sooner, then, did they see Joseph approaching Dothan, where they fed their flocks,
than his brothers thought the time had come at length for humbling their father’s
favourite. The first proposal was to put him instantly to death; but Reuben interposed,
and their sentence was, to throw Joseph into a pit, and leave him to perish unpitied
there! Blinded by envy, or goaded by rage, they trampled on every tender feeling,
and evil became their chief good.
</p>
<p>In the good providence of God, however, the youth was taken from that pit, in which
he was to have been buried alive, and sent to a distant country, there to be the saviour
of not a few, in a temporal sense. To cover their wickedness, his brothers next resolved
to show to their father Joseph’s coat of tartan, <span class="pageNum" id="pb13">[<a href="#pb13">13</a>]</span>dipped in the blood of a kid, as if he had been devoured by ravenous beasts.—Their
brother might become a slave; their father’s heart might be torn with anguish; their
own souls might be deeply stained with sin piled above sin;—but what of all these,
when men are bent on indulging their evil and malignant passions? Let misery be heaped
upon misery, yet men will not be diverted from their iniquity.
</p>
<p>But wicked as their deeds were, and an outrage at once against a father and a brother,
and, above all, against their God, he who makes the wrath of man to praise him employed
that wrath remarkably to work out his purposes in this case. And he is doing the same
at this hour. Think of the miseries, spread over many years of agony, inflicted by
fierce persecutors on the Christians of Madagascar in our day, and then mark how they
increase in number <span class="pageNum" id="pb14">[<a href="#pb14">14</a>]</span>notwithstanding. Think of the bloody massacres in India, the martyrdoms of native
Christians there, with the butchery of all who wear the Christian name; and yet mark
how that is overruled to rouse the churches to spread the truth in that dark-souled
land. Think, above all, of the Cross of Jesus,—of the woes which were there endured,
with all the malignant passions which nailed the Redeemer to the tree; and then see
how God can make our wickedness promote his own glory,—can bring joy out of anguish,
and life out of death, and blessings unutterable out of the very curse (<a class="biblink xd31e40" title="Reference to the Bible: Galatians 3:13" href="https://classic.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gal%203:13&amp;version=NRSV">Gal. iii. 13</a>).

<h2 class="main">JOSEPH SOLD TO THE ISHMAELITES.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="xd31e254"><span class="xd31e254init">W</span>e have just seen that Joseph’s brethren, moved by envy, sold him to some Ishmaelite
merchants, by whom he was carried into Egypt, and there sold as a slave. Regardless
of their brother’s cries, and deaf to all that affection might whisper, the future
patriarchs <i>would</i> make him the victim of their hatred; and it is deeply instructive to notice how many
sins are contained in this one transaction.
</p>
<p>1. There was a sin committed by brothers against a brother. The ties of <span class="pageNum" id="pb16">[<a href="#pb16">16</a>]</span>nature were outraged. Affection was trampled in the dust,—it was in truth cast into
the pit beside Joseph,—it had no power in the hearts of those hating and hateful men.
Surely such a case occurring in the Bible so soon after the murder of Abel by his
brother Cain, was designed by God to show us the terrible ravages wrought by sin in
the soul. Just as war, with its bloody work, has often deflowered the fairest regions
of the earth, does fierce passion waste the soul of man.
</p>
<p>2. There was sin committed against their father. What although the patriarch should
suffer uttermost woe when bereft of his favourite son! or what although his heart
should break when the tidings reached him that Joseph had been cruelly devoured by
a wild beast! It was not to such things that those men would listen: it was to their
own malicious hearts; and, cost what <span class="pageNum" id="pb17">[<a href="#pb17">17</a>]</span>it might to their father, their brother must either die or become a slave. You may
assure the sinner that the wages of sin is death,—you may tell him that agony for
ever is attached to guilt by God’s decree; but all that will not turn the wicked from
his way. God must turn us, or we rush unchecked upon ruin.
</p>
<p>3. In the sin of Joseph’s brethren there was falsehood, and that to a parent. Those
men deliberately plotted to deceive Jacob, by showing him the coat of Joseph dipped
in the blood of a kid. They utterly forgot that God saw them; they listened only to
their own hearts; and sin was added to sin, that their passion might be indulged.
To the crime of murder—the murder of a brother—which some of them were willing to
perpetrate, they added that of deception, deep in itself and sad in all its results.
Now in all this they were just showing us <span class="pageNum" id="pb18">[<a href="#pb18">18</a>]</span>more and more clearly what iniquity lurks or reigns in the heart of man, till the
Almighty Spirit make all things new.
</p>
<p>4. In that sin there was spite, and that against a brother. We have seen that there
is reason to believe (<a class="biblink xd31e40" title="Reference to the Bible: Genesis 37:2" href="https://classic.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gn%2037:2&amp;version=NRSV">Gen. xxxvii. 2</a>) that Joseph had formerly blamed some of the practices in which his brethren indulged
while they were from under their parent’s eye, and that had provoked their antipathy:
“They hated him” when they saw that his father loved him. And here again we see one
reason why men have always ranked envy among the vilest and the meanest of the sins.
</p>
<p>5. It need scarcely be added that there was cruelty in that crime. Those brothers
were deaf to the cries of the stripling; the majority of them were not unwilling to
put him to death amid lingering agonies,—that is, to leave him to die of hunger in
a <span class="pageNum" id="pb19">[<a href="#pb19">19</a>]</span>pit, unheeded and unrelieved. When we see fools making a mock at sin, and multitudes
seeking in it the only pleasure or the only gratification which they know, surely
that is because they do not know the dark depths into which it sinks them!
</p>
<p>6. And, to name no more, there was in that sin the love of money, which is the root
of all evil. Those unnatural brothers, blinded by hatred, and eager to get the offender
out of the way, actually sold him for a slave. They valued gold or silver more than
their brother’s life, his happiness, or his affection. He might have to wear chains,
or carry burdens heavier than he could bear; but what of all that, if their hatred
was indulged, and Joseph put out of their sight! Till then they could not be at ease.
His deportment was a rebuke to them. He seemed holier than they, and because of that
he must suffer; they <span class="pageNum" id="pb20">[<a href="#pb20">20</a>]</span>must contract guilt upon guilt. Now, is not this, in spirit, the very same kind of
sin as that which led Satan to tempt and ruin man?
</p>
<p>Such are some of the views suggested by this sad transaction—the selling of Joseph.
But little did his brothers know that these sins would find them out. Little did they
expect that even upon earth they would see in Joseph all that his dreams had predicted,—themselves
at his feet, and doing him obeisance with all their heart. And little did they know
that God was to be with their brother of a truth, to bless him and make him a blessing.
But so it was; and Joseph became a type of Jesus, persecuted by his brothers, but
exalted by his God; buried out of sight, yet raised to a throne; the victim of malignity
at man’s hand, but beloved of God, and therefore set on high.

<h2 class="main">JOSEPH IN PRISON.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="xd31e333"><span class="xd31e333init">G</span>od has, in his holy providence, made great use of his people in prison. Jeremiah,
Daniel, Paul, Silas, and Peter, were all honoured by him in such a place. Luther,
while a captive in Wartburg Castle, translated a large portion of Scripture, and promoted
the spiritual emancipation of millions in Christendom. Bunyan in his prison, where
blinded persecutors had immured him, wrote a book, second to no human production in
its knowledge of the heart and its delineations of truth. And so of many more. <span class="pageNum" id="pb22">[<a href="#pb22">22</a>]</span>Joseph’s name is to be added to this list. Having been basely accused of a foul crime
which he refused to commit, he was cast into prison, and pined there for years, the
victim of malignity,—or apparently forgotten. Now this seemed the completion and the
cope-stone of the machinations of Joseph’s brethren. When he was immured in that dungeon
at On, in Memphis, in Thebes, or some other of the royal cities of ancient Egypt,
it might appear as if all hope concerning him were gone: his aspirations, whatever
they were, now seemed to be blighted for ever. It was with him, to mortal eye, as
it was with Jesus when he was crucified, dead, and buried,—when a stone was rolled
to the door of the sepulchre,—when the entrance was sealed with a seal, and a guard
of Roman soldiers set, as if they could baffle Omnipotence, and make all escape hopeless.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb23">[<a href="#pb23">23</a>]</span></p>
<p>In truth, however, the imprisonment of Joseph was meant and used by God as a step
to his exaltation. If he was for a season like one entombed, he had a resurrection
at last by the mighty power of Him who sees the end from the beginning. It was like
the planting of an acorn soon to become an oak, or like the bubbling up of a little
stream from the depths of the earth soon to become a mighty river, while all around
exclaimed,—
</p>
<div class="lgouter xd31e112">
<p class="line">“The gloomy mantle of the night,
</p>
<p class="line xd31e114">Which on my sinking spirit steals,
</p>
<p class="line">Will vanish at the morning light
</p>
<p class="line xd31e114">Which God, my East, my Sun, reveals.”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">His God was with Joseph, then, as his sun and shield, even in the prison-house of
Pharaoh, and friends were soon raised up to the Hebrew lad; he was even advanced to
a degree of honour akin to royalty itself. There was no Bible then to embody the <span class="pageNum" id="pb24">[<a href="#pb24">24</a>]</span>mind of God to man, such as it is now our most blessed privilege to enjoy; and in
the absence of such a book, knowledge was sometimes mysteriously imparted by dreams.
We are not able to explain how that took place; but He who made the mind can impress
it as he wills, and he often impressed it by dreams, by visions, or by voices. For
his companions in prison, Joseph had the chief butler and the chief baker of Pharaoh’s
household; and as they dreamed dreams which he was enabled to interpret, that, in
the providence of God, led to his liberation. The chief butler was restored to his
former place in the royal household, as Joseph had foretold; and though he forgot
for a time his companion in prison, yet when the king in his turn was troubled by
certain dreams, the butler remembered Joseph, pointed him out to Pharaoh, and the
captive <span class="pageNum" id="pb25">[<a href="#pb25">25</a>]</span>slave was summoned into the monarch’s presence.
</p>
<p>There for the present we leave him, and observe that Joseph is now on the high road
to dignity and honour. By one of those sudden transitions far from being uncommon
in the East, where impulse often takes the place of principle, or where what appears
to be caprice does the work of system, the prison door is shut behind Joseph, and
that of the palace is opened: he is soon to become the grand vizier of an Oriental
potentate. His brethren had sought to bury him out of sight; for, to their mind, selling
him into Egypt was equivalent to that doom. They had no design but to get rid of a
troublesome or an offensive brother; but as God had restrained the remainder of their
wrath, and in his providence prevented the perpetration of fratricide, so he had further
<span class="pageNum" id="pb26">[<a href="#pb26">26</a>]</span>purposes to serve by that remarkable youth; and Jehovah accordingly hid him in the
hollow of his hand; he was with Joseph when he went out, and when he came in.
</p>
<p>From this time forward, then, all went well with Joseph. He had refused to yield to
temptation to sin. By the help of God, he was steadfast and immovable; he became,
as we shall see, the recognized benefactor of millions. And what was the secret of
all this? The Bible explains it, in one brief clause: “The Lord was with Joseph, and
he was a prosperous man” (<a class="biblink xd31e40" title="Reference to the Bible: Genesis 39:2" href="https://classic.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gn%2039:2&amp;version=NRSV">Gen. xxxix. 2</a>). That is the basis of all true prosperity. With that, we need not fear the face
of man. “The Lord will provide,” may then become our assured confidence. In youth
and in age, in sorrow and in joy, in temptation and in safety, in life and at death,
all will be well, <span class="pageNum" id="pb27">[<a href="#pb27">27</a>]</span>all will prosper, if “the Lord be with us.” Some, indeed, try to prosper without the
Lord’s guidance. They attempt by fraud what they can accomplish only by the Lord’s
blessing upon honesty. Deception is systematized, and iniquity is drawn “as with a
cart rope.” But all is like a building upon the sand, or worse,—upon a sea-wave, unless
the Lord be with us. The whole is found at last to be a mockery, like the mirage of
the desert.
</p>
<p>But what were Joseph’s prison thoughts? Perhaps hope deferred made the heart sick.
Perhaps he sometimes desponded, and because the chief butler long forgot his promise,
the prisoner might fear that God had also forgotten to be gracious. As year passed
after year, till about thirteen had rolled away, who will wonder though his heart
sometimes failed! But after all the Lord is not slack concerning <span class="pageNum" id="pb28">[<a href="#pb28">28</a>]</span>his promise. A thousand years are with him as one day. Joseph was liberated precisely
at the moment best for him and for all Egypt; and it is ever so with those who wait
upon the Lord.
</p>
<p>Now, in connection with these events, it may be observed that we often hear of representative
men—these are men who represent some great interest, or who are the champions of some
great cause. One man, for example, is the representative of great learning; and we
cannot hear him named without thinking of great scholarship, or all varied lore. Another
man represents the cause of the people—not as a demagogue does, for selfish or for
turbulent ends, but for man’s social improvement or social elevation—for man’s happiness,
in short, in time and for ever. Knox, for example, or Chalmers—what intelligent Christian,
with the open Bible <span class="pageNum" id="pb29">[<a href="#pb29">29</a>]</span>for his standard, can hear these names without feeling that these were representative
men? Or a third man represents the martial spirit. We cannot hear <i>his</i> name without thinking of wars, and battles, and victory, and fame—that poor shadow
which men pursue, and blindly speak of as glory. Or a fourth man is the representative
of science; his name almost means science itself. And yet another may be the representative
of ferocity unmatched—of blood-thirstiness which only a Feejee cannibal could surpass.
</p>
<p>Now we find the same thing in the Bible,—it is there in singular prominence and vigour.
Abraham was one representative man; David was another; Isaiah, and Paul, and John,
were others; and we need not scruple to place Joseph among the rest. He was the representative
<span class="pageNum" id="pb30">[<a href="#pb30">30</a>]</span>of a class upon whom Jehovah smiles while mortals frown—whom the Most High exalts,
while his creatures persecute, imprison, or destroy them—whom he crowns with prosperity,
while men would plunge them in misery here, and doom them to endless endurance hereafter.
By Joseph’s case we are taught that there is a God that judgeth in the earth, and
encouraged to commit ourselves in well-doing to him, assured that, though villany
may seem to prosper, there is a curse in it—though God’s people be cast down, they
cannot be destroyed: His right hand will lift them up.

<h2 class="main">JOSEPH INTERPRETING PHARAOH’s DREAMS.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="xd31e387"><span class="xd31e387init">“S</span>eest thou a man diligent in business? he shall stand before kings: he shall not stand
before mean men” (<a class="biblink xd31e40" title="Reference to the Bible: Proverbs 22:29" href="https://classic.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Prv%2022:29&amp;version=NRSV">Prov. xxii. 29</a>). Such is one of the sayings of the wisest man, and we see it fulfilled to the letter
in Joseph’s case. In the house of Potiphar, in the prison where he was unjustly immured,
and everywhere, he did what was just and right, and now we see him (in our Engraving)
literally standing before a king. In many a passage of Scripture God is urgent with
us to do with <span class="pageNum" id="pb32">[<a href="#pb32">32</a>]</span>diligence what he appoints us to do; and he makes it plain that in every case—without
exception, in every case—the path to true honour, true promotion and prosperity, is
the path of duty. For a time, men may get success in iniquity; but their fall and
their crash are the greater. Witness the penury and the shame of the fraudulent bankrupt—the
lordly oppressor—the unjust dealer of every name. The history before us illustrates
all this.
</p>
<p>Pharaoh’s rest had been troubled by dreams, and when summoned, as we have just seen,
into the royal presence, Joseph was able to read them—his God was with him, and he
prospered even in that. He foretold seven years of plenty, to be followed by seven
years of scarcity, according to a twofold emblem seen in the royal visions; and counselled
the king to provide for the evil of famine by treasuring <span class="pageNum" id="pb33">[<a href="#pb33">33</a>]</span>up the produce of the years of abundance. The lean kine and the well-favoured, the
good ears of corn and the bad, helped him to avert a dire calamity. He became the
benefactor of millions; and, according to some, Joseph introduced a practice into
Egypt regarding the tenure of land of which there are vestiges to this day.
</p>
<p>But be that as it may, we see here how Joseph’s advancement begins, and is promoted.
He had honoured God, and is honoured by him. He had held fast his integrity, and now
found that to be the path of peace as well as of prosperity; his equity is brought
forth as the noon-day. His ways pleased the Lord, and even Joseph’s enemies were all
at peace with him. He had been in the furnace, and came forth pure. He had been tempted,
bribed, allured to sin; but his God made him steadfast and immovable; <span class="pageNum" id="pb34">[<a href="#pb34">34</a>]</span>and we are now to see the result. Let us, then, look at some details.
</p>
<p>It seems to be a law in God’s world, that wherever good is to be done, it must be
accomplished by woe. Think again of the highest good ever wrought out upon earth—the
redemption of man by Jesus Christ—and how was that accomplished? By tears, by agonies,
and cries; by a death whose horrors have never yet been told! Or, when Paul would
spread the blessings of redemption, how was that accomplished? By endurance at every
step, by buffetings, stripes, and persecutions! And when Luther would sweep away some
part of the rubbish which had been heaped upon the truth, had he not to take his life
in his hand, and clear his way amid a thousand obstructions and tens of thousands
of enemies, ere he could advance that work? Or, once more, <span class="pageNum" id="pb35">[<a href="#pb35">35</a>]</span>when God would make known his truth in heathen lands, how is it done? As we have already
seen, it is amid throes, and persecutions, massacres, mutinies, and fiendish cruelties.
</p>
<p>Now, Joseph’s case comes under this general rule. He was to become in God’s hand the
instrument of preserving millions from a terrible death; but, to achieve that result,
he must surmount obstruction after obstruction, and rise from a pit into which his
brothers threw him, and a dungeon to which false accusation led. He was to turn famine
into plenty, and dearth into comparative cheapness; and how was it done? He must first
be hated by his brethren; and then he must be sold as a slave; then he must be cast
into a prison, and disciplined there for thirteen years; and only <i>after all these things</i> is he permitted to work the work which God had <span class="pageNum" id="pb36">[<a href="#pb36">36</a>]</span>given him to do. Satan’s malice, and man’s waywardness, impeded Joseph’s way; and
only because the Lord was with him did he prosper in the end against such combined
opponents. Now, just in proportion to the difficulties encountered and surmounted
by him, are we called to recognize the hand of God in what befell. When he has a work
to do, none can hinder; instruments will be found, and his purposes on earth will
be promoted, in spite of all that can resist or gainsay. As well may we expect to
roll back the flowing tide by a word, or make some mighty river like the Amazon or
the St. Lawrence run upward to its fountain, as check, divert, or even retard the
purposes of the Eternal. He will work, and none can hinder: and the grand moral of
Joseph’s touching story is just this,—Man and devils may combine to oppose the <span class="pageNum" id="pb37">[<a href="#pb37">37</a>]</span>cause of God, but on that cause advances, resistless because he is the Almighty.
</p>
<p>But while we glance at Joseph’s promotion thus far, we cannot help adverting to the
state of his unnatural brothers. No doubt they thought that their wicked device had
succeeded; they tried to be at peace, and rejoice in <i>their</i> form of prosperity. They might see their aged father pining nearer and nearer to
the grave from day to day, on account of the loss of Joseph. They might have some
compunctions, and we can scarcely suppose that conscience would be altogether silent;
it would be a rare case, indeed, had they succeeded in stifling entirely the voice
within. But we are told of no repentance, no confession of sin, no humiliation for
murder designed, for falsehood told, for a brother hated, and a father, reduced to
life-long anguish, passing on unsoothed <span class="pageNum" id="pb38">[<a href="#pb38">38</a>]</span>to the grave! Oh, the power of sin! How it perverts man’s nature! how it hardens his
heart into stone! how surely is the power of an Almighty Spirit needed to renew it!
and how blessed when that Spirit has come to make us one spirit with that Living One
of whom Joseph was a type—Jesus, the Son of God!
</p>
<p>We say Joseph was a type of Jesus; at least the life of the one strangely resembled
that of the other. Such resemblances are sometimes fanciful, and pushed further than
sober judgment can sanction, yet in many respects they are striking. Was Joseph, for
example, hated by his brethren? Jesus also came to his own, and his own received him
not. Was Joseph the favourite of his father? In like manner Jehovah proclaimed concerning
Jesus, “This is my beloved Son.” Was Joseph sold by his brethren? So <span class="pageNum" id="pb39">[<a href="#pb39">39</a>]</span>was Jesus. Was the former falsely accused? So was the latter. Was Joseph the saviour
of many from death by starvation? Jesus was the saviour of a multitude, whom no man
can number, from sin. Was Joseph first degraded or dishonoured, and then highly exalted?
The history of the Redeemer’s earthly sojourn tells how wicked men dishonoured or
derided him; but the Scriptures also tell that God highly exalted him, and gave him
a name which is above every name. Was it a proclamation made before Joseph, “Bow the
knee”? (<a class="biblink xd31e40" title="Reference to the Bible: Genesis 41:43" href="https://classic.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gn%2041:43&amp;version=NRSV">Gen. xli. 43</a>). In like <span class="corr" id="xd31e427" title="Source: mannner">manner</span>, “at the name of Jesus every knee shall bow.” Did Joseph feed multitudes? In like
manner Jesus gives us the bread which comes down from heaven. Did Joseph forgive his
unnatural brethren at last? The dying Saviour prayed for his crucifiers: <span class="pageNum" id="pb40">[<a href="#pb40">40</a>]</span>“Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do.”
</p>
<p>We would not carry out this parallel, we repeat, to any fanciful extent; but the coincidences
now mentioned, and many more, are often pointed out. In the estimation of some, they
furnish a proof that the sufferings of the Saviour were prefigured, or predicted,
by those of Joseph; which at least show this—that he that will live righteously must
suffer persecution, whether he be one of the sons of men, or the only Son of God.

<h2 class="main">JOSEPH’S ADVANCEMENT.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="xd31e442"><span class="xd31e442init">I</span>t is instructive to notice how many things were combined, by the providential care
of God, to promote the advancement of Joseph: 1. He dreamed; 2. He told his dreams
to his brethren; 3. He went and visited them at a distance from their father’s home—and,
prior to that, he had been envied by them on account of his father’s partiality; 4.
Reuben and Judah interposed to prevent his being murdered; 5. The Ishmaelites passed
opportunely through Dothan; 6. They bought him; <span class="pageNum" id="pb42">[<a href="#pb42">42</a>]</span>7. They carried him into Egypt, and sold him to Potiphar—not a person of minor influence;
8. Joseph was tempted to sin, but resisted the temptation, and was thrown into prison
on a false accusation; 9. He had for his fellow-prisoners two of Pharaoh’s household;
10. They dreamed dreams; 11. Pharaoh did the same; 12. A former fellow-prisoner of
the Hebrew lad was at hand, to remind the troubled king of that lad’s power. And only
at the end of this long chain—to which still other links might have been added—was
Joseph raised from his degradation; only then did it appear that he who chooses weak
things to confound the mighty had a great work to accomplish in Egypt by the instrumentality
of that man. It seemed darkness without one ray of light when Joseph was torn from
his father and his father’s country, and made <span class="pageNum" id="pb43">[<a href="#pb43">43</a>]</span>not merely a slave, but a close prisoner for several years. But he who makes the wrath
of man to praise him, needed Joseph in Egypt; and by terrible things in righteousness
the purposes of the Eternal were wrought out.
</p>
<div class="figure p042width"><img src="images/p042.jpg" alt="JOSEPH’S ADVANCEMENT." width="507" height="698"><p class="figureHead">JOSEPH’S ADVANCEMENT.</p>
</div><p>
</p>
<p>Now this finely illustrates the exquisite adaptations of the providence of God to
accomplish his designs. The links, how delicate and manifold, yet how firm! The agents,
how free, yet how perfectly controlled! The devices, how deep in some cases, how simple
in others; yet how beautifully all conspire to promote the desired end! Is not this
the finger of God? Does he not vivify all, or restrain all, ever one in purpose as
he is one in essence; and making all advance his glory?
</p>
<p>Contemplate Joseph now, then. He is at the right hand of Pharaoh; for that <span class="pageNum" id="pb44">[<a href="#pb44">44</a>]</span>monarch has said to him, “See, I have set thee over all the land of Egypt. Thou shalt
be over my house, and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled; only in
the throne will I be greater than thou.” Joseph had power now to “bind even princes
at his pleasure;” and we cannot help contrasting the recent slave and prisoner with
the friend and counsellor of royalty, united in the same person. He is adorned with
Pharaoh’s ring, and with a chain of gold. If he has lost his coat of many colours,
he wears the royal raiment of Egypt in its stead. He rides, moreover, in a chariot
of state; and men, as we have seen, now cry before him, “Bow the knee.” Joseph is,
in truth, all but royal; and though such things would not much affect him, if he was
what we believe him to have been—that is, righteous before God—yet they do furnish
<span class="pageNum" id="pb45">[<a href="#pb45">45</a>]</span>a vivid contrast to Joseph’s recent condition. They show us that when God over all
has work to do, he will both find agents and gift them with the means of accomplishing
his purposes. Man seeks to withdraw himself and his affairs entirely from the control
of the Supreme; but he bridles, fetters, or gives liberty, according to his pleasure;
and blessed are they who are his <i>willing</i> people.
</p>
<p>And who could not quote a hundred such examples as that of Joseph from the history
of the past? Nay, may not every man who has had wisdom to watch the ways of God in
dealing with his own soul, single out examples of similar wisdom in the providence
of the Holy One? It may be for retribution on the guilty, or for encouragement to
the men who fear God; but whatever be the design, many signal examples are recorded,
to show that God <span class="pageNum" id="pb46">[<a href="#pb46">46</a>]</span>watches over all human plans, guiding and controlling them, so as to promote the good
pleasure of his will. Man proposes, but God disposes; and he that is wise to mark
the wisdom of the Supreme in such things, will not want for proof of the loving-kindness
of the Lord. During a recent memorable siege in the East, for example, it was the
design of hordes of dark-souled men to explode a mine, and blow their beleaguered
victims into the air; but that mine was prematurely fired, and destroyed only those
emissaries of evil who dug it. Now, this is only a specimen of what takes place in
the providence of God; at least that mine at Lucknow was morally anticipated in the
selling of Joseph by his brethren, and his exaltation to the right hand of Pharaoh
by God, compared with their humiliation before him at last.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb47">[<a href="#pb47">47</a>]</span></p>
<p>Further: we need only to look forward to the closing scene of all, the last and great
Assize, to see examples countless of this general law! What multitudes then will be
seen to have been caught in their own pitfall! How manifest will it then become that
God was over all, even when men were asking, like Pharaoh of old, “Who is the Lord,
that I should fear him?” Now, this may well supply strength to every tried one. God
may permit sorrow to assail; but do we, in godly sincerity, commit our way to him?
Then glory will emerge from that threatened shame; and grief, as in Joseph’s case,
will be found the precursor of joy everlasting.

<p class="xd31e135"><span class="xd31e135init">T</span>he history of Joseph now becomes more and more a history of the triumph of faith over
sight, or holiness over sin. Hitherto transgressors have seemed to prosper in their
way, and only the godly were depressed. But now we are to see the Holy One vindicating
the rights of injured innocence, and more and more plainly proclaiming that the Judge
of all the earth will do right. May we not exclaim, then,—
</p>
<div class="lgouter xd31e112">

</div>
<p class="first">“Be sure your sins will find you out,” is the fixed decree of God; and in the case
of Joseph’s brethren the day of retribution now begins to dawn. If hitherto conscience
had been at ease, or oblivious of their brother, it is now to be roused, and to speak
out for the Holy One who is the Lord of conscience—the just Judge of the skies. The
great white throne and its work are now to be anticipated.
</p>
<p>From the narrative in Genesis we know that a famine had arisen in Egypt, as Joseph
had predicted. Its influence spread from that land into the adjacent countries, and
the sons of Jacob went thither to profit by the stores which the <span class="pageNum" id="pb50">[<a href="#pb50">50</a>]</span>wisdom of that brother whom they had hated and sold had amassed. “All countries came
into Egypt to Joseph, for to buy corn; because that the famine was so sore in all
lands:” and among the rest, the future patriarchs came, and “bowed down themselves
before him with their faces to the earth.”
</p>
<p>In other words, Joseph’s dream is now fulfilled,—his brethren do obeisance to him—they
are prostrate in the Oriental manner at his footstool! All their machinations could
not turn aside the purposes of Jehovah; and neither their projected murder of Joseph,
nor his being sold into Egypt, nor his being a prisoner for years, could interfere
with the onward march or the ceaseless flow of purposes formed in heaven. It cannot
be too strenuously enforced, for it is the burden of the whole Bible, that every wish
of <span class="pageNum" id="pb51">[<a href="#pb51">51</a>]</span>man, every word and deed of the creature, must bend before the will of God. Joseph’s
whole history is a proof; and the history of the whole world, when read in the light
of eternity, will further demonstrate the same truth. “Be still, and know that I am
God,” is the profound but simple lesson which all must learn,—on earth, or in agony
hereafter for ever.
</p>
<p>All obstructions, then, are made to promote the designs of the Eternal; and the sons
of Jacob are therefore now at the feet of their hated younger brother. For their trial,
he spoke roughly unto them, and said, “Ye are spies.” They were thus compelled to
defend themselves in the presence of him whom they had thrown into a pit, and plead
for their lives before one for whom they had no better portion than slavery and exile.
Again and again was the charge, “Ye are spies,” produced <span class="pageNum" id="pb52">[<a href="#pb52">52</a>]</span>against them; and again and again had they to declare that they were true men, though
Joseph knew that they were not. In short, they begin to discover that the way of transgressors
is hard; and to be assured that though hand join in hand, sin shall not escape under
the government of the Holy One.
</p>
<p>It is sometimes not easy to speak or to act towards sinners under the influence of
that pity which their sad case requires. The cutting sarcasm of Elijah to the priests
of Baal, and the irony of Isaiah to the idolaters of his day, appear to be the right
weapons to be used in such a case. Oh, how has reason been dethroned by sin! how has
even conscience been warped and blinded, when men can hope to cope with Omnipotence
and triumph—to plot against Omniscience and escape—to rebel against Love and be happy!
<span class="pageNum" id="pb53">[<a href="#pb53">53</a>]</span></p>
<p>And the scriptural narrative is full upon this point, for it is one of the main designs
of the Bible to restore conscience to its place of power. When tribulation came upon
those men—when their sins began to compass them about with sorrows—it was then that
conscience spoke out: “They said one to another, We are verily guilty concerning our
brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul, when he besought us, and we would
not hear; therefore is this distress come upon us. And Reuben answered them, saying,
Spake I not unto you, saying, Do not sin against the child; and ye would not hear?
therefore, behold, also his blood is required” (<a class="biblink xd31e40" title="Reference to the Bible: Genesis 42:21-22" href="https://classic.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gn%2042:21-22&amp;version=NRSV">Gen. xlii. 21, 22</a>). Their injured brother wept aside while they thus conferred; but, meanwhile, conviction
of sin has been wrought; and, in one point of view, these guilty men are twice in
the dust;—once before <span class="pageNum" id="pb54">[<a href="#pb54">54</a>]</span>God, as detected in their iniquity; and again before their brother, fulfilling the
word of God upon their very knees.
</p>
<p>And this may vividly remind us of what awaits the guilty at the last. Self-detected,
they will also be self-condemned. They will anticipate the verdict of the Judge, and
call on the mountains to fall on them ere ever his sentence be uttered. But were it
not well to anticipate all this at an earlier stage? Were it not well to write bitter
things against ourselves now, and not wait to be condemned with the wicked—to listen
to the voice of a condemning conscience, and so escape the condemnation of God?
</p>
<p>“His blood is required of us,” then,—such was the confession of those men; and, in
confessing that fact, they bowed before the majesty of conscience, as the <span class="pageNum" id="pb55">[<a href="#pb55">55</a>]</span>trees of the forest bow before the storm. Now, it were well could the men of every
name, and class, and age, be brought to recognize that majesty, and in time to do
obeisance before it. It were well were it written up in every place of business, in
every church, in every home, nay, in every heart,—“There is a God that judgeth in
the earth;” “He will bring every work into judgment, with every secret thought.” Were
that remembered, surely it would tend to check man’s proneness to sin, unless he were
prepared openly to conflict with Omnipotence. True, nothing but God’s almighty grace
can subdue our wayward hearts, or make his will our law; yet could we remember Joseph’s
brethren, as we are directed to remember Lot’s wife, it would be well with us: the
Spirit of God would bless it for our <span class="pageNum" id="pb56">[<a href="#pb56">56</a>]</span>good; and both young and old—both viceroys like Joseph and shepherds like his brethren—would
be wiser and happier men.

<h2 class="main">THE CUP IN BENJAMIN’S SACK.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="xd31e135"><span class="xd31e135init">T</span>here can be little doubt that the events recorded in Scripture are designed to illustrate
its moral maxims and its religious principles. Distinguishing aright between what
the God of the Bible approves and what he condemns, we find much light shed upon his
truth by the conduct of those whose lives are recorded there. Truth is never presented
in abstract forms, such as only the studious or the learned can comprehend. On the
contrary, it is embodied in life, now to awe us, and anon to allure; <span class="pageNum" id="pb58">[<a href="#pb58">58</a>]</span>at one time a beacon to warn, at another a signal to encourage or guide.
</p>
<p>But there are many facts mentioned, or customs referred to, in Scripture, with which
we are now but little acquainted. The next incident in Joseph’s history to which we
refer belongs to this class. His brethren were returning the second time from Egypt
with sacks of corn; but in order to stay, or to test them further, he ordered the
cup “whereby he divined” (<a class="biblink xd31e40" title="Reference to the Bible: Genesis 44:5" href="https://classic.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gn%2044:5&amp;version=NRSV">Gen. xliv. 5</a>) to be privately deposited in the sack of Benjamin, who had been sent by his father
with extreme reluctance to Egypt, at the imperative demand of Joseph. His steward
was then ordered to follow them, and seize the party in whose sack the drinking-cup
was found. It was discovered, of course, in Benjamin’s; and now began consternation
to the uttermost among the sons of Jacob. “They <span class="pageNum" id="pb59">[<a href="#pb59">59</a>]</span>rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass, and returned to the city.” They had
hoped to escape from the effects of a sin committed many years ago, but now they must
suffer and be in great trepidation for a sin which they did not commit at all. If
conscience has hitherto been dormant or dead, it is about to be roused to a terrible
activity. It is soon to be with them as with the thief who “dreads an officer in every
bush.”
</p>
<p>The first thing that the guilty brothers did, when they reached the abode of Joseph,
was to “fall before him on the ground,” and so fulfil once more that prediction concerning
them and their doing obeisance which had at first excited their enmity or their envy.
They had to plead their cause with all the force of Eastern pathos before Pharaoh’s
viceroy—their own brother; and their pleading contains <span class="pageNum" id="pb60">[<a href="#pb60">60</a>]</span>some exquisitely tender appeals, thoroughly Eastern in their style, but as thoroughly
human in their nature. Their father’s grief <i>now</i> occupied their thoughts: they were not heartless as before; for when the conscience
was once roused it began to stir the better feelings of the heart. Days of adversity
and trial have at length accomplished some favourable results. As the great I AM had
work for Joseph in the world, he had also work for his brethren to do, and they are
reclaimed from their self-inflicted degradation.
</p>
<p>But what is meant by Joseph’s divining cup? When his brethren appeared before him
to answer for the theft alleged against them, the ruler of Egypt said, “Know ye not
that such a man as I am can certainly divine?” And does that mean that Joseph had
adopted the practices of heathen priests, pretending to forecast the future, <span class="pageNum" id="pb61">[<a href="#pb61">61</a>]</span>and so far usurp the prerogative of God?
</p>
<p>Without going further, the margin of our Bibles may help us to reply to that question.
The word “<i>divine</i>,” in <a class="biblink xd31e40" title="Reference to the Bible: Genesis 44:5" href="https://classic.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gn%2044:5&amp;version=NRSV">Gen. xliv. 5</a> and <a class="biblink xd31e40" title="Reference to the Bible: Genesis 44:15" href="https://classic.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gn%2044:15&amp;version=NRSV">15</a>, is translated on the margin “make trial;” and we are thus, perhaps, referred to
some method adopted in Egypt for testing doubtful cases, by some peculiar use of a
cup. According to others, the word means no more than that Joseph would make strict
scrutiny upon such a point. He would sift and test the character of the men before
him. He would not let them go as innocent, when he had tried them and found them criminal.
By such an announcement Joseph would re-enforce the claims of conscience; he would
deepen the alarms that had already risen in their minds; he was in God’s hands to
work out God’s purposes in those long dormant <span class="pageNum" id="pb62">[<a href="#pb62">62</a>]</span>hearts; for if Joseph could make strict inquiry, those men knew of One who could make
stricter still—the God who looks upon the heart, whose eyes are as a flame of fire,
and who cannot look on sin without abhorrence.
</p>
<p>But however we may interpret what our Bible calls Joseph’s power to divine, we have
no difficulty in understanding the moral lessons of such events, or tracing the hand
of heavenly wisdom, “from seeming evil still educing good.” When Joseph demanded Benjamin
to be brought down, and when that was reported to his father, we know how he was affected.
Joseph, he believed, was lost; Simeon was detained in Egypt as an hostage; Benjamin
is now demanded; and the patriarch exclaimed, “Me have ye bereaved of my children;
Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and ye will take Benjamin away. <span class="pageNum" id="pb63">[<a href="#pb63">63</a>]</span>All these things are against me” (<a class="biblink xd31e40" title="Reference to the Bible: Genesis 42:36" href="https://classic.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gn%2042:36&amp;version=NRSV">Gen. xlii. 36</a>). Now, little did the man who made that sore complaint understand the ways of God,
even after all the experience he had had: he judged like a short-sighted mortal, as
we are ever prone to do, and not as a believer in “the mighty God of Jacob.” He took
counsel of flesh and blood, and not of the God of all grace. He listened to the whispers
of his own heart; and what can follow such a course but woe? The patriarch would have
been nearer the truth—he would have uttered the very truth—had he said the reverse
of what he here declares. And the same is true of us all. We are ever prone to misinterpret
the ways of God. We put false constructions upon his most wise and loving providences:
we judge by sense, and not by faith. When he chastens for our profit, we think that
it is for our ruin; <span class="pageNum" id="pb64">[<a href="#pb64">64</a>]</span>we conclude that we are to be destroyed, when we are only corrected: and thus live
in misery when we might joy in God, as David did when he said, “In very faithfulness
doth he afflict me.” Conscience whispers to many a soul what we deserve from God;
and when sorrows come, conscience generally concludes that they are the first drops
of the vials of wrath.

<h2 class="main">THE MEETING OF JOSEPH AND BENJAMIN.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="xd31e583"><span class="xd31e583init">“J</span>oseph fell upon his brother Benjamin’s neck and wept; and Benjamin wept upon his neck”
(<a class="biblink xd31e40" title="Reference to the Bible: Genesis 45:14" href="https://classic.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gn%2045:14&amp;version=NRSV">Gen. xlv. 14</a>). Such is the word-picture of which one of our Engravings is a copy. There is much
that is lovely and of good report as between man and man in our natures, notwithstanding
of the fall, and one of the fountains of the heart is here broken open. We see how
brother loves brother, and, by contrast with that scene, are enabled to understand
how far the minds of Joseph’s brethren <span class="pageNum" id="pb66">[<a href="#pb66">66</a>]</span>must have been warped and deadened by hatred or envy, when they could trample as they
did upon the affection which should knit brother to brother. Such beautiful displays
of brotherly love were perhaps made in this case just to show more clearly by contrast
the hateful nature of envy in every case, but most of all among brothers.
</p>
<p>Prior to this stage of these proceedings, indeed, Joseph had given some manifestations
of his affection to Benjamin. He showed that his elevation to the right hand of a
throne had neither alienated nor chilled his love; and the fivefold mess which he
sent to Benjamin (<a class="biblink xd31e40" title="Reference to the Bible: Genesis 43:34" href="https://classic.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gn%2043:34&amp;version=NRSV">Gen. xliii. 34</a>), according to the Eastern mode of showing affection, made it plain that the external
change in Joseph’s position had not altered his heart. When he first set eyes on Benjamin,
he could not refrain <span class="pageNum" id="pb67">[<a href="#pb67">67</a>]</span>his tears, but “sought where to weep; and he entered into his chamber, and wept there”
(verses <a class="biblink xd31e40" title="Reference to the Bible: Genesis 43:29-31" href="https://classic.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gn%2043:29-31&amp;version=NRSV">29–31</a>). According to the calmer temperament of Western nations, where self-command in such
cases is more studied, such affection may appear excessive in a high and mighty ruler;
it may seem weak or womanish thus to dissolve into tears, even in the retirement of
one’s chamber. But in less phlegmatic temperaments, and especially among Orientals,
nature takes its own mode of expression—at once the most pathetic and the most powerful;
and the gushings of natural affection, its tenderness, its beauty, and its force,
rank among the finest portions of the Word of God. Jesus wept because Jerusalem would
none of him: it would rather rush upon ruin. The deep yearnings of his loving heart
were outraged, and he wept in anguish there, <span class="pageNum" id="pb68">[<a href="#pb68">68</a>]</span>as in Gethsemane his sweat was as it were great drops of blood. Again, Paul could
tell, even weeping, of some who were the enemies of the cross of Christ, who gloried
in their shame, and drew forth pity for men who had no pity on themselves. In short,
wherever man is not hardened into callousness by the power of the world, or chilled
by conventional usage, he will be as prompt to weep with them that weep as to rejoice
with them that rejoice. It is true, whether poetry record it or not, that—
</p>
<div class="lgouter xd31e112">
<p class="line">“Not the bright stars which night’s blue arch adorn,
</p>
<p class="line">Nor rising sun which gilds the vernal morn,
</p>
<p class="line">Shines with such lustre as the tears that break,
</p>
<p class="line">For other’s woes, down Virtue’s manly cheek.”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">But the scene at which Joseph made himself known to his brethren deserves our closer
attention. He wept sore, and so loudly that the Egyptians heard him. <span class="pageNum" id="pb69">[<a href="#pb69">69</a>]</span>A strange thing that day had happened in their land; and it is not easy to conceive
of the feelings of those brethren when the ruler, so royal-like, beside them, exclaimed,
“I am Joseph!” Surely no lightning flash ever startled more. The words of Nathan to
David, “Thou art the man!” could produce no profounder emotion. In that one clause
the memory of years long past was awakened; and surely the consciences of those men
were busier now than they had ever been before: surely the blush of confusion might
well crimson their cheeks, and the recollection of all their baseness—their cruelty
to their father, their brother, and their own souls—would rush upon their minds with
the vividness of a yesterday’s event. “They were troubled at his presence”—the margin
says “terrified.” And well they might; it was as if one had risen from the dead, or
as if a miracle <span class="pageNum" id="pb70">[<a href="#pb70">70</a>]</span>had been wrought to confront them with their sin. When he said, “I am Joseph your
brother, whom ye sold into Egypt!” would not the words sound like the first portion
of a sentence of death and execution? But he hastened to relieve their fears. “Be
not grieved,” he said, “nor angry with yourselves, that ye sold me hither; for God
did send me before you to preserve life.” And when he “kissed all his brethren, and
wept over them,” they no doubt felt a mountain-load lifted from their minds. Joseph
had forgiven them; nay, more, he had found an excuse or palliation for their sin.
But could they forgive themselves? If they were not utterly abandoned to guilt—and
we know that they were not—could they find rest anywhere but in the dust at that solemn,
searching moment? Oh, how would many, now undone and beyond hope for ever, rejoice
<span class="pageNum" id="pb71">[<a href="#pb71">71</a>]</span>could such an hour of contrition be granted to them here!
</p>
<p>Here, then, we may contemplate the state of these detected men, when their sin was
pressed upon their notice by their brother, all kind and forgiving as were his words.
The chief sin of all—the sale into slavery—had been committed many years before: it
seemed over and forgotten, like a thing buried and out of sight. But no; sin has a
vitality in it which defies alike oblivion and death; it is enduring, as the nature
of God is unchanging; and the guilty brothers are thus confronted with their sin,
fresh and vigorous, as if yesterday had seen it perpetrated. And is not this but a
rehearsal or a foreshadowing of the great and final day, when the Judge of the quick
and the dead is to set our sins in array against us, or when it will seem a relief
if the mountains would fall on us <span class="pageNum" id="pb72">[<a href="#pb72">72</a>]</span>and cover us from the wrath of the Lamb? Happy the man who has his soul washed in
the Lamb’s blood preparatory to that day! We should never forget that there is to
be a resurrection of our deeds as well as of our bodies, and should live so as to
be ready to render our account with joy.

<h2 class="main">THE MEETING OF JACOB AND JOSEPH.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="xd31e628"><span class="xd31e628init">I</span>f we have witnessed one scene of affection when Joseph embraced his brother Benjamin,
we are now to behold another, when the patriarch Jacob meets with his long lost son.
We are often permitted, even in this life, to see joy and gladness according to the
days in which we have seen grief; and an example of that is at hand.
</p>
<p>After the interview between Joseph and his brethren, matters were soon arranged for
transferring them and all their retinue to Egypt,—another important stage in the <span class="pageNum" id="pb74">[<a href="#pb74">74</a>]</span>development of God’s plans with our world. Pharaoh confirmed the request of his viceroy
to that effect, so that the patriarchs and their father with them were invited to
settle in one of the richest portions of Egypt. Among these migratory tribes of herdsmen—who
literally had no continuing city—such a removal was not so remarkable as a similar
thing would be in our country of more fixed habits; and the whole house of Jacob was
accordingly soon in motion toward Egypt. “It is enough,” he exclaimed, when the invitation
reached him; “Joseph my son is yet alive: I will go and see him before I die;” and
the threescore and six souls, who composed his household, of course followed in his
train.
</p>
<p>Now, had we been there to witness that migration, it would never have occurred to
us to think that the future history of <span class="pageNum" id="pb75">[<a href="#pb75">75</a>]</span>the sons of men would be largely affected by the movement; yet it was so. That was
no ordinary change of abode: God was in it of a truth; and, blind or dark as man might
be, God was there in the act of “calling things that are not as though they were.”
</p>
<p>As he journeyed toward Egypt, Jacob met with much to gladden him by the way. In a
vision of the night, he was encouraged from on high to go fearlessly forward, for
blessings great and manifold awaited him and his descendants in the future. But our
present topic leads us past the different stages of the journey, to the meeting of
the father and the son. When Joseph learned that his parent was approaching, he hastened
forth to meet him, and, with the ardent affection, as well as the profound respect,
of the East, welcomed the aged man to Egypt. He <span class="pageNum" id="pb76">[<a href="#pb76">76</a>]</span>did not think it beneath his dignity, as vice-king of that country, to offer lowly
reverence to his father, shepherd or husbandman as he was, and following a profession
which made him “an abomination unto the Egyptians.” Nay, when Joseph met his father
in the land of Goshen, we read that “he fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a good
while” (<a class="biblink xd31e40" title="Reference to the Bible: Genesis 46:29" href="https://classic.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gn%2046:29&amp;version=NRSV">Gen. xlvi. 29</a>); while the father exclaimed, “Now, let me die, since I have seen thy face, because
thou art still alive.”—It was an interview and an hour which compensated, in a great
measure, for the sorrows and separation of years; it was one of the scenes by which
God, in his holy providence, foreshows how intense will be the joy when the great
family are all gathered home, from every country, and tribe, and tongue, to their
Father’s house on high. The exile returning to the home of his fathers, <span class="pageNum" id="pb77">[<a href="#pb77">77</a>]</span>or the soldier revisiting the scenes of his boyhood after many a bloody field, may
understand such emotions in some degree. They are green spots in the desert of life—a
Tadmor in the wilderness—a lily among thorns.
</p>
<p>Yet there, also, the feelings would be of a mixed nature, like all things human. Scarcely
any of the parties present—Jacob, Joseph, or his brethren—could fail to glance in
thought at the strange proceedings which had separated them so long. There might be
neither envy nor hatred now—neither spite upon the one side, nor a desire of retaliation
on the other. The dealings of Providence had been too remarkable to admit of such
feelings; and we rather suppose that they were all suppressed, as much as possible,
amid the general joy. But be that as it may, we see the patriarch happy for a season.
His <span class="pageNum" id="pb78">[<a href="#pb78">78</a>]</span>children, who were really the hope of the world (strange as the remark may seem when
applied to such men), were now gathered around him; and as it then appeared that he
had little to do but to die, he might at length put a different construction on his
own words: “All these things are against me.” He had providence now interpreted to
him by its God, and saw with his bodily eyes, as all the ransomed will yet see in
glory, that “all things work together for good to them that love God, and that are
the called according to his purpose.” Flesh and blood may fear and quake under trial,
but faith rises to a higher level, and walks with a firmer step,—it can endure as
seeing him who is invisible.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="xd31e254"><span class="xd31e254init">W</span>e have seen that the son stood before kings, and the father is now to do the same.
If we have beheld not a little in former scenes to commend Joseph to our love, we
are here to see yet more. As soon as he met his father, he communicated his purpose
to apply to Pharaoh to sanction the sojourn of the patriarch and his tribe in Egypt.
This was easily arranged; and at the close of the proceedings, Joseph “brought in
Jacob his father, and set him before Pharaoh: and Jacob blessed Pharaoh” <span class="pageNum" id="pb80">[<a href="#pb80">80</a>]</span>(<a class="biblink xd31e40" title="Reference to the Bible: Genesis 47:7" href="https://classic.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gn%2047:7&amp;version=NRSV">Gen. xlvii. 7</a>). When this was accomplished, we can suppose that the highest wishes of one so affectionate
as Joseph were gratified. For about seventeen years his parent lived to bless him
with his company and his counsel; and though we have not many details of their intercourse
during that period, we may easily imagine that the tenderness of those seventeen years
largely compensated for the long and violent separation which had kept the father
and the son so far apart, and even made them the citizens of different kingdoms.
</p>
<p>But we may notice here, in passing, the question of Pharaoh, and the answer of Jacob,
at their interview. “How old art thou?” was the monarch’s inquiry; and Jacob’s reply
was a picture in words of the weary life of man: “The days of the years of my pilgrimage
are an hundred and thirty years: few and evil have the <span class="pageNum" id="pb81">[<a href="#pb81">81</a>]</span>days of the years of my life been, and have not attained unto the days of the years
of the life of my fathers, in the days of their pilgrimage” (<a class="biblink xd31e40" title="Reference to the Bible: Genesis 47:9" href="https://classic.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gn%2047:9&amp;version=NRSV">Gen. xlvii. 9</a>). <i>Few and evil!</i> Behold the history of a life whose days were protracted even beyond the ordinary
span! Few and evil, because man is born to trouble as the sparks fly upward. Few and
evil, because it is written, “Dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.” Few
and evil, because, in this special case, there had been more than common grief endured,
where those who should have been a solace or a stay were transformed by sin into causes
of anguish, first to their aged parent, and at last also to themselves.
</p>
<p>And how sad must the reply of Jacob have sounded in the ears of the king! It rarely
happens that monarchs are permitted to hear unpleasant truths. Everything <span class="pageNum" id="pb82">[<a href="#pb82">82</a>]</span>around them seems to proclaim or to whisper that to-morrow will be as to-day; or if
different, only more joyous and more thoughtless still! For once, however, the hoary-headed
patriarch tells the monarch the truth, and indirectly reminds him, Thou, too, must
die. There was another king, the King of Terrors, mightier than Pharaoh, and slowly
approaching to lay him in the dust.
</p>
<p>And perhaps there is nothing in all the history or the life of man which shows more
clearly the effects of sin, or the ruin of the fall, than his wilful ignorance, or
at least his want of feeling, on the great subject of his mortality. Of no truth is
it possible for man to be more convinced than this—<i>I must die</i>. It is not so absolutely certain that the sun will rise on any given day, as that
man may die any moment or any breath. Yet who is moved by that conviction to prepare
for <span class="pageNum" id="pb83">[<a href="#pb83">83</a>]</span>dying? Who is stirred up by all the funerals which he sees, or all the open graves
which he visits, to prepare for meeting God? Not one. It is not that kind of influence:
it is the grace and the Spirit of God that make man wise to consider his latter end.
For example, the plaintive sentiment, “Few and evil,” uttered by the patriarch, most
probably passed through the monarch’s mind like water through a sieve. A sigh, or
a wish, or a hope, perhaps, and all was over! The thought was dashed aside as an unwelcome
intruder amid the gorgeous scenes of a palace. And if that was the case, Pharaoh was
only a specimen of the universal race of man. The fleeting nature of life is forgotten
amid its cares, its engrossments, and trifles. But happy they whom the Spirit of God
makes wise in this and other respects! Happy they who cling, <span class="pageNum" id="pb84">[<a href="#pb84">84</a>]</span>as Jacob did, to Him who is the life, and over whom death has no power for ever!
</p>
<p>In the African desert there is a bird, known as the honey-guide, which often conducts
the traveller to some hive, whose sweet stores form a staple article of food in those
dreary parts. By a peculiar instinct, provision is thus made to supply the wayfarer’s
wants; or, in some cases, to rescue him from death. Now God has yet more wisely and
surely provided for our escape from the second death, if we listen to the warnings
of his Word or the guidance of his Spirit; and happy are they who are thus guided!
They are led to a portion sweeter far than honey from the honey-comb. The few and
weary days of our earthly pilgrimage then conduct us to the house of the Lord—the
city of the Great King—the abode to which the palace of Pharaoh was as a dungeon or
a cell.

<p>And in concluding these sketches, we may glance again at the mode in which the mighty
God brought good to all nations and all times out of the misdeeds of the sons of Jacob.
In our world there is much to perplex and bewilder us in studying the ways of Providence,
and it is not always easy—for <i>us</i>, at least—to “justify the ways of God to man;” but he will sooner or later justify
them himself, and make it plain to all that his ways, like his Word, are pure.
</p>
<p>For example, we have already seen what benefits accrued to Joseph himself from the
cruelty of his brethren, and how fully he recognized the hand of God in all that <span class="pageNum" id="pb87">[<a href="#pb87">87</a>]</span>had befallen him. Just as Jehovah will make it plain at last, before the assembled
world, that the very wrath of man has praised him, in the present instance he made
the evil passions of those brothers remarkably advance the eternal purposes of the
God of heaven. The promises made to Adam and to Abraham are here helped a stage forward
to their fulfilment in spite of all that seems to oppose. Somehow or other, though
we cannot see it, or explain it at all, even sin—the abominable thing which God hates—will
be made to promote his glory; and of that result we have a specimen in the events
of this remarkable family.
</p>
<p>To Jacob, also, as well as to the land of Egypt, we see what benefits resulted from
the sin of his sons. All the guilt of that sin lay upon them, and was not in the least
jot mitigated by the manner in which <span class="pageNum" id="pb88">[<a href="#pb88">88</a>]</span>God overruled it for good; but it is full of encouragement to a child of God, to see
it working out the purposes of his Father. Jacob was saved from death by starvation;
his family, and myriads besides, were the same: and thus he who sought only to do
evil by stirring up the envy of Joseph’s brethren, was compelled to do good thereby
again and again.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
